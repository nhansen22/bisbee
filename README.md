# Bisbee
alternative splicing analysis package.  

Bisbee perfoms differential splicing analysis, splicing outlier analysis, and splice isoform protein sequence prediction.  Each of these analysis steps may be run independently or may be combined into a pipeline using the workflows below.  Bisbee also provides utility scripts for extracting data, annotating, filtering and summarizing results.  Bisbee has been developed and tested using splice variant detection data from [SplAdder](https://github.com/ratschlab/spladder).

`python utils/prep.py merge_graphs_mutex_exons_C3.counts.hdf5 MUT counts/WangKuster.MUT 2 WangKuster_testSamples.txt`

output event_jid column:
 - unique identifier for each splice events to faciliate comparisons across studies
 - format: `contig + 's' + strand + ':g' + iso1_junc + '>' + iso2_junc + '[spl' + event_type + ']'`

 output file columns:
  - event_cat: type of splicing event
    - Alt3: alternate 3  prime splice site
    - Alt5: alternate 5 prime splice site
    - MutEx: mutually exclusive exons
    - *group*ExonInc: exon skip/inclusion with *group* having more inclusion
    - *group*IntronRet: intron retained/excluded with *group* having more retention
  - group_higher: sample group with more of the isoform resulting in the sequence in the "altPept" column
  - aa_change_type: type of amino acid change relative to ensembl
    - Canonical: protein coding event with both isoforms are in ensembl
    - Novel: the splice event generates novel transcript and novel amino acid sequence
    - Other: protein coding event that does not fit neatly into novel or canonical criteria.  Either it is novel at the transcript level, but does not generate a novel protein sequence.  Or the event does exist in known transcripts, but altering a transcript that does not have the event to have event results in a novel protein sequence.  This likely indicates that the transcripts with different isoforms of the event have different start codons and Bisbee predicted protein change may not be correct.
    - ND: effect was not determined
    - None: non-coding transcripts, silent, or protein loss events
  - effect_cat:
    - Substitution: amino acid substitution between isoforms, with the group indicated in the "group_higher" column having more of the isoform with sequence in the "altPept" column, and the other group having more of the isoform with the sequence in the "refPept" column
    - Insertion: amino acid insertion/deletion, with the group indicated in the "group_higher" column having more of the isoform with the insertion
    - Deletion: amino acid insertion/deletion, with the group indicated in the "group_higher" column having more of the isoform with the deletion
    - Truncation: amino acid sequence is truncated
    - FrameDisruption: splice event causes use of a different stop codon and altered amino acid sequence
    - ProteinLoss: splice event causes loss of start or stop codon
    - NonCoding: splice event only effects non-coding transcripts
    - NA: effect not available
    
## Other utility scripts
### Find minimum outlier scores between two reference sets
Sometimes it is useful to generate outlier scores using two different reference sets (for example, one set is better matched technically to the samples of interested, but another set has more diverse or better matched normal samples).  The min score script with find the mininum score of two sets of outlier scores for each event x sample.  If either has an nan, the score will be nan.
`python utils/minScore.py scoreFile1 scoreFile2 outname`

example:
`python utils/minScore.py WangKuster.lowerGI.MUT.bisbeeOutlier.csv WangKuster.gtexGI.MUT.bisbeeOutlier.csv WangKuster.lowerGI.gtexGI.MUT.minScore.bisbeeOutlier.csv`

### Count outlier burden by sample
`python utils/sampleScoreBinCounts.py out_folder outname thresh`
Counts the number of events per sample with outlier scores above or below the outlier threshold and with no score. Outputs a table where each row contains a sample, and each column is an event_type by outlier bin. The outlier bins are
 - low_out: score <= -thresh
 - not_out: -thresh < score < thresh
 - high_out: score <= thresh
 - no_score: score not available, typically indicates no coverage at event
 
 ### Count outlier burden by annotations and sample
`python utils/sampleScoreBinCounts.py out_folder outname thresh anno_file`
Counts the number of outlier events and events with coverage per sample in each annotation category out of the events in the anno_file.  Produces two output files.  In both each row is a sample and each column is an annotation category (event_cat x group_increased_alt x aa_change_type x effect_cat)
 - samplePassCounts.csv: counts of events passing the outlier threshold for each sample in each category.
 - sampleScoreCounts.csv: counts of events with non-nan outlier scores for each sample in each category.  Note that only events in the *anno_file* are counted.

## Workflows
Workflows are provided for use in the [jetstream](https://github.com/tgen/jetstream) pipeline framework. The workflows will divide the dataset into chunks and performs each step in parallel on the chunk.  The filter step at the end of the workflows will pull significant events into a single file.  If jetstream is run on a computing cluster with a slurm scheduler, the "--backend slurm" option may be used to submit each task as a slurm job.  If jetstream is run with the (default) local backend, each task will be launched as a process on the local machine.
